# Finance Navigator Pro – Loan Portfolio Dashboard

An interactive Tableau dashboard suite for analyzing loan applications, funding performance, risk (good vs. bad loans), and key metrics in a consumer lending business.

Built with Tableau Public/Desktop using a Financial_loan dataset (~38K applications).

## Project Overview
This portfolio project visualizes critical lending KPIs to help stakeholders monitor:
- Total applications, funded & received amounts
- Month-over-Month (MoM) and Month-to-Date (MTD) trends
- Good vs. Bad loan performance (86% good issuance rate in this dataset)
- Breakdowns by purpose, state, term (36/60 months), employee length, home ownership, grade, verification status
- Detailed loan-level table with filters

Three main views:
- **Summary**: High-level KPIs, good/bad loan donuts, loan status table
- **Overview**: Trends over time, geographic map, term/purpose/employee breakdowns
- **Details**: Granular loan records table with filters
